**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**
AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt data. It operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits or 16 bytes for AES).AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):**
CBC is a mode of operation for block ciphers, including AES.It introduces a form of feedback to the encryption process by XORing each plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.This makes each block of ciphertext depend on all previous plaintext blocks, increasing security.CBC requires an Initialization Vector (IV) to start the chain.

**Counter Mode (CTR):**
CTR is another mode of operation for block ciphers like AES.It turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, allowing for parallel encryption and decryption.It generates a unique keystream for each block of plaintext by encrypting a counter value.CTR mode doesn't require padding, as it encrypts each plaintext block independently.

**Padding:**
Padding is necessary when the length of plaintext is not a multiple of the block size. It adds extra bytes to the plaintext to make it the correct length for encryption. Common padding schemes include PKCS#7 (also known as PKCS5), where the value of each added byte is the number of bytes added.

In summary, when using AES with CBC mode, you need to ensure that your plaintext is padded to a multiple of the block size (16 bytes for AES). CBC mode requires an Initialization Vector (IV) for the first block. On the other hand, AES in CTR mode doesn't require padding, as it turns the block cipher into a stream cipher. Each block of plaintext is encrypted independently.
